All RDS files and the project are located in sessions folder.

This project aims to analyze a subset of data collected by Steinmetz et al. (2019) from mouse experiments involving visual stimuli and neural activity recordings. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the outcome of each trial based on the neural activity data and stimulus information. The project is divided into three main parts: exploratory data analysis, data integration, and model training and prediction. Through these analyses, we seek to gain insights into the data structures, neural activity patterns, and session-specific variations. The performance of the predictive model will be evaluated using test sets randomly selected from two sessions. This project report presents the findings and discusses the implications of the analysis.
